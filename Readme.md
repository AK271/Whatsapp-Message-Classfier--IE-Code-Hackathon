Description: 
A classifier built for WhatsApp messages to group them i nto categories. In regular chats, there
are so many unwanted messages where differentiating becomes difficult and itâ€™s time
consuming and i mportant messages easily get lost. So our classifier will help the user to go
through them very quickly and save our time.

Instructions to run the file:
1)Install flask 
2)Download the Messageclassifierproject folder and run app.py file


The messageclassifier python notebook contains the code to various models that we tried for predicting the classes of the messages 
The model.pkl file consists of the final model that we used to classify
